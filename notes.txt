Requirements:
API Endpoints:

● Category Listing: Create an API endpoint that retrieves a list of categories.
● Product Listing: Create an API endpoint that retrieves a list of products with
essential details such as title, price, description, and availability, based on
category Id
● Product Details: Implement an endpoint that fetches the detailed information of
a specific product by its ID.
● Cart Management: Develop API endpoints to allow users to add products to
their cart, view the cart, update quantities, and remove items from the cart.
● Order Placement: Create an endpoint to handle order placement, allowing users
to place an order with products from their cart.
● Order History: Implement an endpoint to fetch the order history for
authenticated users.
● Order Details: Create an endpoint that retrieves the detailed information of a
specific order by its ID.
● A set of APIs to register and login the users

NOTE: Ignore any payment-related APIs for simplicity. We will assume that payment
is not needed for orders

Database Integration:
Use any SQL database preferably Postgres. The API should interact with DB to
perform CRUD operations on products, cart items, and orders.


User Authentication:
● Implement user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Users should be
able to register, log in, and obtain a token to authenticate API requests.
● Implement authentication middleware to secure sensitive API endpoints, such as
cart management and order placement. Only authenticated users should be
allowed to access these endpoints.

Error Handling:
Ensure appropriate error handling is in place, and the API returns meaningful error
messages and status codes when necessary.
